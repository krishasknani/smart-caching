## Test 3: Extension Works Without Server (Simple Caching)

### Setup:

1. Ensure server is NOT running (stop with Ctrl+C if running)
2. Edit `config.js`: Set `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: false`
3. Reload extension in Chrome

### Steps:

1. Open extension popup
2. Navigate to `https://example.com`
3. Click "Cache This Page"

### Expected Results:

- [ ] No server status indicator shown (hidden)
- [ ] Button shows "Caching..." while processing
- [ ] Alert shows "Page cached successfully! (üìÑ Simple caching)"
- [ ] Page appears in cached pages list
- [ ] Clicking "View" opens cached page
- [ ] Background console shows "üìÑ Using simple scraping..."

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 4: Extension Detects Server Availability

### Setup:

1. Edit `config.js`: Set `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: true`
2. Ensure server is running: `cd prototype && npm start`
3. Reload extension in Chrome

### Steps:

1. Open extension popup
2. Look for server status indicator

### Expected Results:

- [ ] Server status indicator is visible
- [ ] Shows green dot (‚óè) with "Advanced caching available"
- [ ] Status checks within 3 seconds

### Test Server Offline:

1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Close and reopen extension popup

### Expected Results:

- [ ] Server status indicator is visible
- [ ] Shows red dot (‚óè) with "Using simple caching"

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 5: Extension Works With Server (Advanced Caching)

### Setup:

1. Ensure server is running
2. Edit `config.js`: Set `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: true`
3. Reload extension in Chrome

### Steps:

1. Navigate to `https://example.com`
2. Open extension popup
3. Verify green status indicator
4. Click "Cache This Page"

### Expected Results:

- [ ] Button shows "Caching..." while processing
- [ ] Alert shows "Page cached successfully! (üé≠ Advanced caching)"
- [ ] Page appears in cached pages list
- [ ] Background console shows "üé≠ Attempting to cache with Playwright"
- [ ] Background console shows "‚úÖ Playwright cache successful"
- [ ] Server terminal shows caching progress
- [ ] Cached page includes images and assets

### Test with Complex Site:

1. Navigate to `https://github.com`
2. Click "Cache This Page"
3. Wait for completion (may take 30-60 seconds)

### Expected Results:

- [ ] Caching completes successfully
- [ ] Alert shows advanced caching method
- [ ] Cached page looks complete with styling

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 6: Fallback Behavior Works

### Setup:

1. Server is running
2. `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: true`
3. Extension loaded

### Steps:

1. Open extension popup (should show green status)
2. Navigate to `https://example.com`
3. Click "Cache This Page"
4. While caching, stop the server (Ctrl+C in server terminal)

### Alternative Test (Easier):

1. Edit server.js temporarily to make cache endpoint return error
2. Try caching a page

### Expected Results:

- [ ] Caching doesn't fail completely
- [ ] Background console shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Playwright failed, falling back to simple scraping"
- [ ] Alert shows "Page cached successfully! (üìÑ Simple caching)"
- [ ] Page is cached using simple method

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 7: CORS Headers Work

### Steps:

1. Open extension popup
2. Open DevTools on popup (right-click popup ‚Üí Inspect)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Try caching a page

### Expected Results:

- [ ] No CORS errors in console
- [ ] Fetch requests to localhost:3000 succeed
- [ ] No "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 8: Configuration Changes Reflected

### Test 1: Disable Playwright

1. Edit `config.js`: `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: false`
2. Reload extension
3. Open popup

**Expected:**

- [ ] Server status indicator hidden
- [ ] Simple caching used

### Test 2: Change Server URL

1. Edit `config.js`: `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_URL: "http://localhost:9999"`
2. Reload extension
3. Open popup

**Expected:**

- [ ] Server status shows red/offline (server not on port 9999)

### Test 3: Change Timeout

1. Edit `config.js`: `PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT: 5000` (5 seconds)
2. Try caching a slow site
3. Should timeout faster

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 9: Error Handling

### Test Server Connection Timeout:

1. Edit server.js: Add `await sleep(10000)` at start of cache endpoint
2. Try caching with 3-second timeout
3. Should fall back to simple caching

### Test Invalid URL:

1. Try caching `chrome://extensions/`
2. Should show "Cannot cache this page (restricted URL)"

### Test Network Error:

1. Disconnect internet
2. Try simple caching
3. Should show appropriate error

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail

---

## Test 10: Integration Test (Full Workflow)

### Scenario: User switches between modes

1. **Start with simple caching:**

   - Set `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: false`
   - Cache 2-3 pages
   - Verify they work

2. **Enable Playwright:**

   - Start server
   - Set `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED: true`
   - Reload extension
   - Cache 2-3 different pages
   - Verify they use advanced caching

3. **Server goes down:**

   - Stop server
   - Try caching another page
   - Should fall back automatically

4. **Restart server:**
   - Start server again
   - Open popup
   - Should show green status again

**Expected:**

- [ ] All cached pages viewable
- [ ] Method indicators correct
- [ ] No data loss between switches
- [ ] UI updates appropriately

**Status:** ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail
